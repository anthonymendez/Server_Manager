## What is Server Manager?

Server Manager is an open-ended website tool based on Python Plugins you can create yourself, or download from others.

## How do I use Server Manager?

Just download the project, and in a terminal run

`py debug.py`

or

`py run.py`

then you can navigate to `localhost:5000` and see the website appear. 

More configurability coming soon!
